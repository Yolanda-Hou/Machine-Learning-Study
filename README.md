## Logistic regression
### What is logistic regression
- Logistic regression is a type of classification model for supervised machine learning.
- Logistic regression finds the best possible fit between the predictor and target variables to predict the probability of the target variable belonging to a labeled class/category. 
### How to perform logistic regression in R
- use the Smarket data set from the ISLR package as an example
- fit the logistic regression model to predict Direction using Lag1,Lag2,Lag3,Lag4,Lag5, and Volume
- NOTE: When fitting a logistic regression model using the glm() function, you need to specify family="binomial"
- see detail in example code
