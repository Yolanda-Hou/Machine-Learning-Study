## Linear regression
## What is linear regression
- A linear regression is a statistical model that analyzes the relationship between a response variable (often called y) and one or more variables and their interactions (often called x or explanatory variables).
- linear regression assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables. This means that you can fit a line between the two (or more variables). 
- Simple linear regression is a useful approach for predicting a response on the basis of a single predictor variable.
- In practice we often have more than one predictor, where we need to use the muliple linear regression. 
## How to perform linear regression in R
- use `cars` dataset that comes with R by default.
- us `lm()` function to fit the model then use `summary()` function to get some detailed information
- see example code for detail
